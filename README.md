# Entrepreneurship (Work in Progress)

Hey I'm Chiedo, ðŸ‘‹

I created this repo:

- To share some of my key learnings from my experience in Entrepreneurship
- To think out loud about some of my generalized high-level thoughts and opinions surrounding entrepreneurship
- To communicate quick thoughts that come to mind around specified areas of the entreprenuership journey 

I have experience:

- Owning and running small technology businesses (under 20 in size)
- Boostrapping businesses (no external funding or VCs)
- Working in large technology businesses (AOL, GitHub, Microsoft)
- Creating jobs
- Moving digital bits
- Generating marginal profits

I do not have experience:

- Owning and running large businesses or non-technology businesses
- Raising capital from angel investors or VCs 
- Moving physical products
- Generating explosive profits

As you read any or all of this, keep in mind that I'm mostly just thinking out loud. And maybe something you read may or may not resonate with you or be helpful. ðŸ˜„
