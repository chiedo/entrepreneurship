# Entrepreneurship (Work in Progress)

Hey I'm Chiedo, ðŸ‘‹

I created this document:

- To share some of my key learnings from my experience in Entrepreneurship
- To communicate some generalized high-level opinions on Entrepreneurship

I have experience:

- Owning and running small technology businesses (under 20 in size)
- Boostrapping businesses (no external funding or VCs)
- Creating jobs
- Moving digital bits
- Generating marginal profits

I do not have experience:

- Owning and running large businesses or non-technology businesses
- Raising capital from VCs 
- Moving physical products
- Generating explosive profits
